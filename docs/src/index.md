# TransferEntropy.jl

This package exports two functions, [`transferentropy`](@ref) and [`mutualinfo`](@ref).

In order to compute either quantity, combine your input data with one of the available 
[estimators](@ref estimators). Docstrings for [`transferentropy`](@ref) and 
[`mutualinfo`](@ref) give overviews of currently implemented estimators for either 
function.
