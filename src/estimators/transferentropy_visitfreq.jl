distribution by visitation frequencies [1], calculate
transfer entropy from the embedding `E`, given a
discretization scheme controlled by `\epsilon` and
information `v::TEVars`about which columns of the embedding to
consider for each of the marginal distributions. From these
marginal distributions, we calculate marginal entropies and
insert these into the transfer entropy expression.


If `normalise_to_tPP = true`, then the TE estimate is normalised to
the entropy rate of the target variable, `H(target_future | target_presentpast)`.
