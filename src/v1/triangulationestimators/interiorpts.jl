    interiorpts(simplex_vertices, n_fillpoints = 100, sample_randomly = true)

Generate a total of `n_fillpoints` points lying inside the simplex defined 
by `simplex_vertices` (a vector of column vectors).

If `sample_randomly = true`, then points are generated randomly inside each
subsimplex. If `sample_randomly = false` (default), then points are generated
as the centroids of the subsimplices resulting from a shape-preserving
refinement of the simplices in the convex hull.

## Arguments
- **``sáµ¢``**: An array where each column is a simplex vertex.
- **``n_fillpoints``**: The number of points to fill the simplex with. 
- **``sample_randomly``**: Should points be sampled randomly within the
    intersection? Default is `sample_randomly = false`, which inserts points
    inside the intersecting volume in a regular manner.
