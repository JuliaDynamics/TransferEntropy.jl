# TransferEntropy.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kahaaga/TransferEntropy.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kahaaga/TransferEntropy.jl)

Julia package for computing transfer entropy (TE), conditional mutual information (CMI) or any other information theoretic functional.

This package provides essential algorithms for the [`CausalityTools.jl`](https://github.com/kahaaga/CausalityTools.jl) package, which provides methods to detect causal relationship from time series, and tools for computating the transfer operator and invariant measures from time series. See the [`CausalityTools.jl` docs](https://kahaaga.github.io/CausalityTools.jl/dev/) for more information.
