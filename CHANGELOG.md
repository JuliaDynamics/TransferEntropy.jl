# Release 0.4.0
- New method for `transferentropy_visitfreq` leveraging the new binning methods in `CausalityToolsBase`, which makes the estimator even faster. The syntax is `transferentropy(pts, ϵ, vars; b = 2)` where `pts` can be a vector of vectors, `SVector`, `MVector`, or even a `DynamicalSystems.Dataset`. `ϵ` is the instructions for constructing a rectangular partition scheme, and should be provided as a `RectangularBinning` instance, e.g. `RectangularBinning(5)` for five subdivisions of each axis of the embedding. `vars` is a `TEVars` instance with instructions for which embedding axes go into which marginals when 
computing transfer entropy. The base of the logarithm may be specified with the keyword argument `b`, which defaults to `b = 2`, giving the entropy in bits.
