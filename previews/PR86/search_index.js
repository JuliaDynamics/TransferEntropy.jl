It contains equally-sized datapoints of length D, represented by SVector{D, T}. These data are contained in the field .data of a dataset, as a standard Julia Vector{SVector}.\n\nWhen indexed with 1 index, a dataset is like a vector of datapoints. When indexed with 2 indices it behaves like a matrix that has each of the columns be the timeseries of each of the variables.\n\nDataset also supports most sensible operations like append!, push!, hcat, eachrow, among others, and when iterated over, it iterates over its contained points.\n\nDescription of indexing\n\nIn the following let i, j be integers,  typeof(data) <: AbstractDataset and v1, v2 be <: AbstractVector{Int} (v1, v2 could also be ranges, and for massive performance benefits make v2 an SVector{X, Int}).\n\ndata[i] == data[i, :] gives the ith datapoint (returns an SVector)\ndata[v1] == data[v1, :], returns a Dataset with the points in those indices.\ndata[:, j] gives the jth variable timeseries, as Vector\ndata[v1, v2], data[:, v2] returns a Dataset with the appropriate entries (first indices being \"time\"/point index, while second being variables)\ndata[i, j] value of the jth variable, at the ith timepoint\n\nUse Matrix(dataset) or Dataset(matrix) to convert. It is assumed that each column of the matrix is one variable. If you have various timeseries vectors x, y, z, ... pass them like Dataset(x, y, z, ...). You can use columns(dataset) to obtain the reverse, i.e. all columns of the dataset in a tuple.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"mutualinfo/","page":"Mutual information","title":"Mutual information","text":"mutualinfo\nconditional_mutualinfo","category":"page"},{"location":"mutualinfo/#TransferEntropy.mutualinfo","page":"Mutual information","title":"TransferEntropy.mutualinfo","text":"mutualinfo(x, y, est; base = 2, q = 1)\n\nEstimate mutual information between x and y, I^q(x y), using the provided  entropy/probability estimator est from Entropies.jl or specialized estimator from  TransferEntropy.jl (e.g. Kraskov1), and Rényi entropy of order q (defaults to q = 1, which is the Shannon entropy), with logarithms to the given base.\n\nBoth x and y can be vectors or (potentially multivariate) Datasets.\n\nWorth highlighting here are the estimators that compute entropies directly, e.g. nearest-neighbor based methods.

Assumes that the input data are sequential (time-ordered).\n\nThis implementation follows the grid estimator approach in Diego et al. (2019)[Diego2019].\n\nDescription\n\nThe transfer operator P^Nis computed as an N-by-N matrix of transition  probabilities between the states defined by the partition elements, where N is the  number of boxes in the partition that is visited by the orbit/points. \n\nIf  x_t^(D) _n=1^L are the L different D-dimensional points over  which the transfer operator is approximated,  C_k=1^N  are the N different  partition elements (as dictated by ϵ) that gets visited by the points, and  phi(x_t) = x_t+1, then\n\nP_ij = dfrac\n x_n  phi(x_n) in C_j cap x_n in C_i \n x_m  x_m in C_i \n\nwhere  denotes the cardinal. The element P_ij thus indicates how many points  that are initially in box C_i end up in box C_j when the points in C_i are  projected one step forward in time. Thus, the row P_ik^N where  k in 1 2 ldots N  gives the probability  of jumping from the state defined by box C_i to any of the other N states. It  follows that sum_k=1^N P_ik = 1 for all i. Thus, P^N is a row/right  stochastic matrix.\n\nInvariant measure estimation from transfer operator\n\nThe left invariant distribution mathbfrho^N is a row vector, where  mathbfrho^N P^N = mathbfrho^N. Hence, mathbfrho^N is a row  eigenvector of the transfer matrix P^N associated with eigenvalue 1. The distribution  mathbfrho^N approximates the invariant density of the system subject to the  partition ϵ, and can be taken as a probability distribution over the partition elements.\n\nIn practice, the invariant measure mathbfrho^N is computed using  invariantmeasure, which also approximates the transfer matrix. The invariant distribution is initialized as a length-N random distribution which is then applied to P^N.  The resulting length-N distribution is then applied to P^N again. This process  repeats until the difference between the distributions over consecutive iterations is  below some threshold. \n\nProbability and entropy estimation\n\nprobabilities(x::AbstractDataset, est::TransferOperator{RectangularBinning}) estimates    probabilities for the bins defined by the provided binning (est.ϵ)\ngenentropy(x::AbstractDataset, est::TransferOperator{RectangularBinning}) does the same,    but computes generalized entropy using the probabilities.\n\nSee also: RectangularBinning, invariantmeasure.\n\n[Diego2019]: Diego, D., Haaga, K.

Here, we resolve this issue by letting the user provide a custom \"less-than\" function. The keyword lt accepts a function that decides which of two state vector elements are smaller. If two elements are equal, the default behaviour is to randomly assign one of them as the largest (lt = Entropies.isless_rand).

This implementation   is based on Azami & Escudero (2016) [Azami2016].\n\nProbability estimation\n\nUnivariate time series\n\nTo estimate probabilities or entropies from univariate time series, use the following methods:\n\nprobabilities(x::AbstractVector, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator).

Thus, if provided, it is required that length(x) == length(s) if x is a Dataset, or length(s) == length(x) - (m-1)τ if x is a univariate signal that is to be embedded first.\n\nUse the following signatures (only works for SymbolicPermutation).\n\nprobabilities!(s::Vector{Int}, x::AbstractVector, est::SymbolicPermutation) → ps::Probabilities\nprobabilities!(s::Vector{Int}, x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicPermutation) → ps::Probabilities\n\nMultivariate datasets\n\nAlthough not dealt with in the original paper describing the estimators, numerically speaking, permutation entropies can also be computed for multivariate datasets with dimension ≥ 2 (but see caveat below). Such datasets may be, for example, preembedded time series. Then, just skip the delay reconstruction step, compute and symbols directly from the L existing state vectors mathbfx_1 mathbfx_2 ldots mathbfx_L.\n\nprobabilities(x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator). Compute ordinal patterns of the   state vectors of x directly (without doing any embedding), symbolize those patterns,   and compute probabilities as (weighted) relative frequencies of symbols.\ngenentropy(x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator). Computes probabilities from   symbol frequencies using probabilities(x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator),   then computes the order-α generalized (permutation) entropy to the given base.\n\nCaveat: A dynamical interpretation of the permutation entropy does not necessarily hold if computing it on generic multivariate datasets. Method signatures for Datasets are provided for convenience, and should only be applied if you understand the relation between your input data, the numerical value for the permutation entropy, and its interpretation.\n\nDescription\n\nAll symbolic estimators use the same underlying approach to estimating probabilities.\n\nEmbedding, ordinal patterns and symbolization\n\nConsider the n-element univariate time series x(t) = x_1 x_2 ldots x_n. Let mathbfx_i^m tau = x_j x_j+tau ldots x_j+(m-1)tau for j = 1 2 ldots n - (m-1)tau be the i-th state vector in a delay reconstruction with embedding dimension m and reconstruction lag tau. There are then N = n - (m-1)tau state vectors.\n\nFor an m-dimensional vector, there are m possible ways of sorting it in ascending order of magnitude. Each such possible sorting ordering is called a motif. Let pi_i^m tau denote the motif associated with the m-dimensional state vector mathbfx_i^m tau, and let R be the number of distinct motifs that can be constructed from the N state vectors. Then there are at most R motifs; R = N precisely when all motifs are unique, and R = 1 when all motifs are the same.\n\nEach unique motif pi_i^m tau can be mapped to a unique integer symbol 0 leq s_i leq M-1. Let S(pi)  mathbbR^m to mathbbN_0 be the function that maps the motif pi to its symbol s, and let Pi denote the set of symbols Pi =  s_i _iin  1 ldots R.\n\nProbability computation\n\nSymbolicPermutation\n\nThe probability of a given motif is its frequency of occurrence, normalized by the total number of motifs (with notation from [Fadlallah2013]),\n\np(pi_i^m tau) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left(mathbfx_k^m tau right) sum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) in Pi left(mathbfx_k^m tau right) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left(mathbfx_k^m tau right) N\n\nwhere the function mathbf1_A(u) is the indicator function of a set A. That     is, mathbf1_A(u) = 1 if u in A, and mathbf1_A(u) = 0 otherwise.\n\nSymbolicAmplitudeAwarePermutation\n\nAmplitude-aware permutation entropy is computed analogously to regular permutation entropy but probabilities are weighted by amplitude information as follows.\n\np(pi_i^m tau) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left( mathbfx_k^m tau right)  a_ksum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) in Pi left( mathbfx_k^m tau right) a_k = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left( mathbfx_k^m tau right)  a_ksum_k=1^N a_k\n\nThe weights encoding amplitude information about state vector mathbfx_i = (x_1^i x_2^i ldots x_m^i) are\n\na_i = dfracAm sum_k=1^m x_k^i  + dfrac1-Ad-1 sum_k=2^d x_k^i - x_k-1^i\n\nwith 0 leq A leq 1. When A=0 , only internal differences between the elements of mathbfx_i are weighted. Only mean amplitude of the state vector elements are weighted when A=1. With, 0A1, a combined weighting is used.\n\nSymbolicWeightedPermutation\n\nWeighted permutation entropy is also computed analogously to regular permutation entropy, but adds weights that encode amplitude information too:\n\np(pi_i^m tau) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i\nleft( mathbfx_k^m tau right)\n w_ksum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) in Pi\nleft( mathbfx_k^m tau right) w_k = dfracsum_k=1^N\nmathbf1_uS(u) = s_i\nleft( mathbfx_k^m tau right)  w_ksum_k=1^N w_k\n\nThe weighted permutation entropy is equivalent to regular permutation entropy when weights are positive and identical (w_j = beta  forall  j leq N and beta  0). Weights are dictated by the variance of the state vectors.\n\nLet the aritmetic mean of state vector mathbfx_i be denoted by\n\nmathbfhatx_j^m tau = frac1m sum_k=1^m x_j + (k+1)tau\n\nWeights are then computed as\n\nw_j = dfrac1msum_k=1^m (x_j+(k+1)tau - mathbfhatx_j^m tau)^2\n\nNote: in equation 7, section III, of the original paper, the authors write\n\nw_j = dfrac1msum_k=1^m (x_j-(k-1)tau - mathbfhatx_j^m tau)^2\n\nBut given the formula they give for the arithmetic mean, this is not the variance of mathbfx_i, because the indices are mixed: x_j+(k-1)tau in the weights formula, vs. x_j+(k+1)tau in the arithmetic mean formula. This seems to imply that amplitude information about previous delay vectors are mixed with mean amplitude information about current vectors. The authors also mix the terms \"vector\" and \"neighboring vector\" (but uses the same notation for both), making it hard to interpret whether the sign switch is a typo or intended. Here, we use the notation above, which actually computes the variance for mathbfx_i.\n\n[BandtPompe2002]: Bandt, Christoph, and Bernd Pompe. \"Permutation entropy: a natural complexity measure for time series.\" Physical review letters 88.17 (2002): 174102.\n\n[Berger2019]: Berger, Sebastian, et al. \"Teaching Ordinal Patterns to a Computer: Efficient Encoding Algorithms Based on the Lehmer Code.\" Entropy 21.10 (2019): 1023.\n\n[Fadlallah2013]: Fadlallah, Bilal, et al. \"Weighted-permutation entropy: A complexity measure for time series incorporating amplitude information.\" Physical Review E 87.2 (2013): 022911.\n\n[Rényi1960]: A.

(2004) [Montalto2014].\n\nImplementation details\n\nThe BBNUE method uses a bootstrap-based criterion to identify the most relevant and  minimally redundant variables from the the past of target, present/past of source,  and (if given) the present/past of cond, that contribute most to target's future. \n\nThis implementation uses a conditional entropy minimization criterion for selecting variables, which is what Montalto et al. (2014)[Montalto2014] uses for their bin-estimator. Here, any  estimator can be used, but variables will be selected using conditional entropy minimization  regardless of the choice of estimator.\n\nMontalto et al.'s bin-estimator corresponds to using the VisitationFrequency estimator with bins  whose sides are equal-length, e.g. VisitationFrequency(RectangularBinning(0.5)).  In this implementation, any rectangular binning can be used.\n\nInput data\n\nMultivariate source, target and cond (if given) can be given as univariate  AbstractVectors or as multivariate Datasets or Vector{AbstractVector}. \n\nFor example, if you want to compute  the BBNUE-transfer entropy from a univariate source to a univariate target,  potentially conditioned on many different variables, you can do the following:\n\nn = 1000\n# Source and target variables\ns, t = rand(n), rand(n)\n\n# Variables that might potentially influence `t` along with `s`\nc1, c2, c3 = rand(n), rand(n), rand(n)\n\nest = NaiveKernel(0.3)\nbbnue(s, t, Dataset([c1, c2, c3]), est)\n\nVariable selection and significance testing\n\nIn this implementation, the maximum lag for each embedding variable is determined using estimate_delay  from DelayEmbeddings. The keywords method_delay (the default is \"ac_min\") controls the method  for estimating the delay, and maxlag is the maximum allowed delay (if maxlag ∈ [0, 1] is a fraction,  then the maximum lag is that fraction of the input time series length, and if maxlag is an integer,  then the maximum lag is maxlag).\n\nIf instantaneous is true, then instantaneous interactions are also considered, i.e. effects like  source(t) → target(t) are allowed. η is the forward prediction lag. \n\nSignificance testing is performed using a permutation test. At each iteration of the  variable selection routine, we first compute the transfer entropy using the new candidate  c_k. Then, the computation is repeated nsurr times, at each iteration replacing c_k  with a surrogate of type surr. If transfer entropy using the original c_k exceeds the  the 1 - α-quantile of that of the surrogate ensemble, then c_k is deemed significant  to the future of target and is included in the set of selected variables.\n\nIf no relevant variables pass the permutation test, then TE is not well-defined, and a value of 0.0 is returned.\n\nReturns\n\nA 6-tuple is returned, consisting of:\n\nte: The computed transfer entropy value. \njs: The indices of the selected variables. js[i] is the i-th entry in the array [idxs_source..., idxs_target..., idxs_cond...,].\nτs: The embedding lags of the selected variables. τs[i] corresponds to js[i].\nidxs_source: The indices of the source variables.\nidxs_target: The indices of the target variables.\nidxs_cond: The indices of the conditional variables (empty if cond is not given).\n\nExample\n\nusing CausalityTools, DynamicalSystems\nsys = ExampleSystems.logistic2_unidir(c_xy = 0.8, r₁ = 3.78, r₂ = 3.92)\norbit = trajectory(sys, 10000, Ttr = 10000)\nx, y = columns(orbit)\n\n# Use a coarse-grained rectangular binning with subdivisions in each dimension,\n# to keep computation costs low and to ensure the probability distributions \n# over the bins don't approach the uniform distribution (need enough points \n# to fill bins).\nest = NaiveKernel(0.3)\nte_xy = bbnue(x, y, est, surr = RandomShuffle(), nsurr = 100, include_instantaneous = true)\nte_yx = bbnue(y, x, est, surr = RandomShuffle(), nsurr = 100, include_instantaneous = true)\n\nte_xy, te_yx\n\n[Montalto2014]: Montalto, A.; Faes, L.; Marinazzo, D.

In short, the embedding lags τT, τS, τC must be zero or negative, the  prediction lag η𝒯 must be positive, and the embedding dimensions dT, dS, dC, d𝒯  must be greater than or equal to 1. Thus, the convention is to use negative lags to  indicate embedding delays for past state vectors (for the T, S and C marginals,  detailed below), and positive lags to indicate embedding delays for future state vectors  (for the mathcal T marginal, also detailed below). \n\nThe default behaviour is to use scalar timeseries for past state vectors (in that case, the τT, τS or τC does not affect the analysis).\n\nDescription\n\nTransfer entropy on scalar time series\n\nTransfer entropy[Schreiber2000] between two simultaneously measured scalar time series s(n) and t(n),   s(n) =  s_1 s_2 ldots s_N  and t(n) =  t_1 t_2 ldots t_N , is is defined as \n\nTE(s to t) = sum_i p(s_i t_i t_i+eta) log left( dfracp(t_i+eta  t_i s_i)p(t_i+eta  t_i) right)\n\nTransfer entropy on generalized embeddings\n\nBy defining the vector-valued time series, it is possible to include more than one  historical/future value for each marginal (see 'Uniform vs. non-uniform embeddings' below for embedding details):\n\nmathcalT^(d_mathcal T eta_mathcal T) = t_i^(d_mathcal T eta_mathcal T) _i=1^N, \nT^(d_T tau_T) = t_i^(d_T tau_T) _i=1^N, \nS^(d_S tau_S) = s_i^(d_T tau_T) _i=1^N,  and \nC^(d_C tau_C) = s_i^(d_C tau_C) _i=1^N.\n\nThe non-conditioned generalized and conditioned generalized forms of the transfer entropy are then\n\nTE(s to t) = sum_i p(ST mathcalT) log left( dfracp(mathcalT  T S)p(mathcalT  T) right)\n\nTE(s to t  c) = sum_i p(ST mathcalT C) log left( dfracp(mathcalT  T S C)p(mathcalT  T C) right)\n\nUniform vs. non-uniform embeddings\n\nThe N state vectors for each marginal are either \n\nuniform, of the form x_i^(d omega) = (x_i x_i+omega x_i+2omega ldots x_i+(d - 1)omega),    with equally spaced state vector entries.

Note: When constructing marginals for T, S and C,    we need omega_i leq 0 for all omega_i to get present/past values, while omega_i  0 for all omega_i    is necessary to get future states when constructing mathcalT.\n\nIn practice, the dT-dimensional, dS-dimensional and dC-dimensional state vectors  comprising T, S and C are constructed with embedding lags τT,  τS, and τC, respectively. The d𝒯-dimensional future states mathcalT^(d_mathcal T eta_mathcal T) are constructed with prediction lag η𝒯 (i.e. predictions go from present/past states to  future states spanning a maximum of d𝒯*η𝒯 time steps). Note: in Schreiber's paper, only the historical states are defined as  potentially higher-dimensional, while the future states are always scalar.\n\nEstimation\n\nTransfer entropy is here estimated by rewriting the above expressions as a sum of marginal  entropies, and extending the definitions above to use Rényi generalized entropies of order  q as\n\nTE^q(s to t) = H^q(mathcal T T) + H^q(T S) - H^q(T) - H^q(mathcal T T S)\n\nTE^q(s to t  c) = H^q(mathcal T T C) + H^q(T S C) - H^q(T C) - H^q(mathcal T T S C)\n\nwhere H^q(cdot) is the generalized Rényi entropy of order q.
